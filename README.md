# fvtt-scripting
I'm learning scripting for Foundry VTT
* Apply Aura - Uses Sequencer to apply a small set of curated J2BA effects on tokens
* Khul Powers - Azarr Khul is pulling powers from the FANE
* Khul Protections - Azarr Khul applies a protective shield to himself.
* Light a Torch - Checks if you have one available and then lights it... illuminating the scene around you.
* Magical Field - Apply magical field around a target.
* Passive Perception - whisper the PP of players in a folder
* Raging Dwarf - Manages homebrew condition where a magical item invigorates a character with rage, strength etc.
* Random Actor - Pick a random actor from those selected.
* Teleport Tokens - who talking to a new location on the map without dragging them.
* Wisdom Save - Offers a wisdom saving throw to selected players.

## Chat Cheats for dice rolls
* [[/r d20+@skills.wis.total # Wisdom Check]]{Wisdom Check} - calls for a wisdom save but does not evaluate it.
