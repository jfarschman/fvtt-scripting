# fvtt-scripting
I'm learning scripting for Foundry VTT
* Apply Aura - Uses Sequencer to apply a small set of curated J2BA effects on tokens
* Light a Torch - Checks if you have one available and then lights it... illuminating the scene around you.
* Raging Dwarf - Manages homebrew condition where a magical item invigorates a character with rage, strength etc.
* Random Actor - Pick a random actor from those selected.
* Wisdom Save - Offers a wisdom saving throw to selected players.

## Cheat in Chat
* [[/r d20+@skills.wis.total # Corruption Check]]{Corruption Check} - calls for a wisdom save but does not ecaluate it.
